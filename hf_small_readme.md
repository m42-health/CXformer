# Model Card for CXFormer

![CXformer Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/m42-health/CXformer/refs/heads/main/figures/overview.jpg?token=GHSAT0AAAAAAC3YAMZYT6BPW5QYQWJ6OBM62A4TUWQ)

CXformer is a vision transformer tailored for chest X-ray analysis, adapted from DINOv2 with clinically motivated training modifications. This repository provides code for pretraining CXformer using our optimized pipeline, as well as scripts for finetuning on downstream tasks like classification, segmentation, and report generation.
For more details on pre-training, please checkout [our paper](link_to_paper).

## Key highlights:
- Improved training with register tokens, teacher centering, and optimized attention heads.
- Self-supervised pretraining on 600K+ CXRs from 5 global datasets.
- Strong generalization across 3 core tasks: classification, segmentation, and report generation.
- CXformer(S) matches the performance of RAD-DINO with 7Ã— less training compute (in FLOPS).
- Models are available on Hugging Face ðŸ¤—: [CXformer(B)](https://huggingface.co/m42-health/CXformer-base), [CXformer(S)](https://huggingface.co/m42-health/CXformer-small)


## Pretrain Dataset
CXformer was pretrained on publicly available datasets, focusing on frontal views of chest X-rays (PA/AP):

- CheXpert
- MIMIC-CXR
- PadChest
- NIH-CXR8
- BRAX

The official training splits were used for CheXpert, MIMIC and NIH, and all available samples in BRAX and PadChest were used in pretraining.

## Downstream Tasks
| Task                | Dataset(s)                        |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Image Classification| CheXpert, NIH-CXR8, RSNA, VinDr   |
| Segmentation        | CheXmask                          |
| Report Generation   | MIMIC-CXR, IU-Xray                |


## Usage

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoImageProcessor
from PIL import Image

model_name = 'm42-health/CXformer-base' # or "m42-health/CXformer-small"

image_processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(model_name,trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

model.eval()

image = Image.open('sample_cxr.png')

image = image_processor(image, return_tensors='pt')
print(image['pixel_values'].shape) # [1,3,518,518]

print("Doing forward...!!")
output = model(**image).last_hidden_state  # [1, 1374, 768]

```


<!-- ## Evaluation Results -->
<!-- We report downstream finetuning performance on three tasks: 1) image classification; 2) semantic anatomy segmentation, and 3) image-to-text radiology report generation. We report the median and 95% confidence intervals over 500 bootstrapped samples.
